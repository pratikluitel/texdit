## Texdit for Reddit
--- 
A reddit post fetcher app in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - expo

Currently fetches only the default/best page. Subreddits can be added to the subreddits array in `./HomeComponents.js`

Doesn't fetch full pictures yet (it was too slow). Only the thumbnail. The goal was to only fetch the text post (as indicated by the name of this app, but ehh why not)
